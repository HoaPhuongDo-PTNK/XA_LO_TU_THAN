## üéÆ Features

### Core Gameplay
- **Procedural Maze Generation**: Each game generates a unique, challenging maze with multiple paths and dead ends
- **Always Solvable**: Mazes are guaranteed to have a solution path but include many wrong routes and dead ends
- **Visual Feedback**: Player and enemy trails with smooth fading effects
- **Solution Path**: Animated green path shows the solution when you lose (only on death)
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time timer and distance counter

### ü§ñ Smart Enemy AI
- **Dynamic Behavior**: Enemies alternate between goal-seeking movement and intelligent player tracking
- **A* Pathfinding**: When tracking, enemies use A* algorithm to navigate the maze efficiently
- **Tracking Cycles**: Every 6 seconds, enemies track the player for 6 seconds (indicated by orange color)
- **Adaptive Speed**: Enemy speed varies by difficulty - Easy: 15% faster, Medium: 20% faster, Hard: 25% faster when tracking
- **Goal-Seeking Movement**: When not tracking, enemies move toward the goal at 85% of player speed
- **Smart Spawning**: Enemies spawn at the player's starting position with a brief delay
- **Anti-Blocking**: Enemies are designed to never permanently block the exit
- **Memory System**: Enemies remember recent moves to avoid getting stuck in loops

### üé® Modern UI/UX
- **Gradient Backgrounds**: Beautiful color gradients for visual appeal
- **Rounded Elements**: Modern card-style UI with rounded corners
- **Non-Intrusive HUD**: Game information displayed without blocking gameplay
- **Overlay System**: Game over and victory screens appear above the maze
- **Responsive Design**: UI adapts to different maze sizes

### ‚ú® Visual Effects
- **Smooth Animations**: All movements and effects are fluid and polished
- **Trail Effects**: Purple player trail and red enemy trails with fade-out
- **Death Animation**: Solution path animates smoothly when the player loses
- **Color Coding**: 
  - Blue: Player
  - Red: Enemies (goal-seeking mode)
  - Orange: Enemies (tracking/hunting mode)
  - Purple: Player trail
  - Green: Solution path (death only)
  - Yellow: Goal

## üéØ Controls

- **Arrow Keys** or **WASD**: Move the player
- **R**: Restart the game with a new maze
- **ESC**: Quit the game

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Install Python 3.7+**
2. **Install Pygame**:
   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```
   Or install from requirements.txt:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Game

```bash
python main.py
```

## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Objective
Navigate from the blue starting position to the yellow goal while avoiding red enemies.

### Enemy Behavior
- **Goal-Seeking Phase (Red)**: Enemies move toward the goal at 85% of player speed, creating constant pressure
- **Tracking Phase (Orange)**: Every 6 seconds, enemies actively hunt the player for 6 seconds
- **Pathfinding**: Enemies use intelligent A* pathfinding to navigate around walls
- **Difficulty-Based Speed**: 
  - Easy: 15% faster than player when tracking
  - Medium: 20% faster than player when tracking  
  - Hard: 25% faster than player when tracking
- **Timing**: After tracking ends, enemies always wait a full 6 seconds before tracking again

### Scoring
- **Time**: How long you survived or took to complete the maze
- **Distance**: Total distance traveled (measured in grid cells)
- **Difficulty**: Based on maze size and enemy count

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Maze Generation
- Uses a recursive backtracking algorithm with additional complexity layers
- Creates multiple branching paths, dead ends, and wrong routes to challenge players
- Strategically places dead end branches off main paths for maximum confusion
- Guarantees a solution path exists from start to goal
- Optimized for challenging but fair gameplay with multiple route choices

### Pathfinding
- **Player Movement**: Direct grid-based movement with collision detection
- **Enemy AI**: A* algorithm for optimal pathfinding through the maze
- **Solution Display**: Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path for the solution visualization

### Performance
- Efficient rendering with minimal CPU usage
- Smooth 60 FPS gameplay
- Optimized collision detection and pathfinding

## üõ†Ô∏è Customization

The game can be easily modified by adjusting constants in `main.py`:

```python
# Maze dimensions
MAZE_WIDTH = 25
MAZE_HEIGHT = 20

# Enemy settings
NUM_ENEMIES = 3
ENEMY_TRACKING_DURATION = 360  # 6 seconds at 60 FPS
ENEMY_CHANCE_INTERVAL = 360    # 6 seconds at 60 FPS
DIFFICULTY_SETTINGS = {
    1: {"enemies": 1, "enemy_speed_multiplier": 1.15},  # Easy: 15% faster
    2: {"enemies": 2, "enemy_speed_multiplier": 1.20},  # Medium: 20% faster
    3: {"enemies": 3, "enemy_speed_multiplier": 1.25}   # Hard: 25% faster
}

# Visual settings
CELL_SIZE = 25
TRAIL_FADE_SPEED = 5
SOLUTION_ANIMATION_SPEED = 3
```

- **`maze_generator.py`**: Maze generation and pathfinding algorithms
- **`requirements.txt`**: Python package dependencies
- **`test_game.py`**: Test script for maze generation and pathfinding

## üì¶ Dependencies

- **Collections**: For deque data structures in pathfinding

## üîç Features in Detail

### Trail System
- **Player Trail**: Purple squares that fade out over time, showing your path
- **Enemy Trails**: Red squares that mark enemy movement paths
- **Smooth Fading**: All trails use alpha blending for smooth visual effects

### Solution Path Animation

- **Animation**: Green path animates from start to goal
- **Timing**: 1-second delay after animation completes before showing game over screen
- **Algorithm**: Uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find the optimal solution

### Enemy AI States

2. **Tracking (Orange)**: Active pursuit of player using A* pathfinding at difficulty-based speeds
3. **Cooldown**: 6-second wait between tracking phases

- **Game Over Screen**: Shows final stats and restart option
- **Victory Screen**: Celebrates successful maze completion
- **Modern Styling**: Gradient backgrounds and rounded UI elements

## üéØ Strategy Tips

- **Watch the Colors**: Red enemies are seeking the goal, orange enemies are actively hunting you
- **Use Dead Ends**: The maze now has many dead ends - use them to confuse enemies but don't get trapped
- **Route Planning**: Multiple paths exist - explore to find the best route while avoiding enemies
- **Use the Walls**: Break line of sight to confuse enemy pathfinding
- **Trail Awareness**: Your purple trail helps you avoid going in circles
- **Timing**: Learn the enemy tracking cycle (6 seconds goal-seeking, 6 seconds tracking)
- **Difficulty Awareness**: Higher difficulties have faster enemies when tracking
- **Solution Path**: When you die, watch the green animation to learn the optimal route
